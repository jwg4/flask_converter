# Flask-Converter

## A flask extension for easily loading URL converters.

This functionality is probably a bad idea, as it is very simple to load url converters using the notes at http://w
 - http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/routing/#custom-converters
 - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Flask.url_map

However, worth completing just to have confidence in my ability to make a flask extension which actually works.
